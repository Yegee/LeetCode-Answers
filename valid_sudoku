36. Valid Sudoku
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Brute Force:
Use Hashmap and make nested loops to check each box
We want to create four nested loops, two for each box and two for each row and column of the boxes.
Add to the hashmap if the number is found and if it is already in the haskmap when we check, it will be invalid

Optimial.
Similar to how the hashmap does it, but instead use a set() because it is more efficent in checking for duplicates. 
Sets willl save you space complexity and time since it doesn't need to create a value as well as other duplicates.
In terms of complexity, it should be O(n^2) no matter what or at least similar since n will be the same no matter what, which is 9x9 or 9 for each box.
