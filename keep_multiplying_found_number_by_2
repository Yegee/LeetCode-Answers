'''

Keep Multiplying Found Number by 2

You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.

You then do the following steps:

If original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).
Otherwise, stop the process.
Repeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.
Return the final value of original.

Brute Force (Applicate):
Make a while loop that goes until the size of nums
Go through the array, if num is found, multiply it by 2 then reset the array.
Goes until num is not found again.
O(n), O(1)

Optimal:
Make a while loop, check if original is inside array "num"
If inside, multiply original by 2
If not inside, return final value of original.
O(1), O(1)
