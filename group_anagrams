Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Brute Force:
Create loop where it will check each letter in the word if it matches. If there is a match, add it to the group. If not, create a new one

Real Solution:
Create a hashmap that will save all of the anagrams. Then create set the values to each anagram into the word in the list.
Each iteration should search in the hashmap if there is a hash with the same letters and append it to the value, which is a list. 
After the iterations of the list are finish, return all of the values of the anagrams as a list, which should be each arrays of the words that are anagrams

        #Tuple, used to make it hashable and comparable
        key = tuple(sorted(hash_map.items()))

        if key in anagrams:
            anagrams[key].append(word)
        else:
            anagrams[key] = [word]

    return list(anagrams.values())
