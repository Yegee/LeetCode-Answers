11. Container with most water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line 
are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Brute Force:
Look at each pair individually and see what has the largest area. 
The equation for each area is "Right - Left * min(height[left], height[right])
Return the highest area saved.

Optimal code:
Make a two pointer of the left and right. each iteration should push the left or right counter inwards as long as the next one is higher. If not, 
the it will be skipped. There should be no way to move it since moving inward on a smaller height should always equate to a lower area
To end the loop, we always make the right pointer move in no matter what, since it will loop forever otherwise.

Return the highest area recorded.
