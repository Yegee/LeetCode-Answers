'''
Search Matrix

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Brute Force (Recursive):
Check the first row for target.
If not found, recursively search the remaining rows.
Stops when target is found or matrix is empty.
Time: O(m * n)
Space: O(m) (recursive call stack)

Optimal:
N/A (no optimization applied beyond linear scan of rows)
