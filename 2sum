2 Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Brute Force:
Make a nested for loop. The first loop is the first multiple and the second is the rest of the array.
Iterate through the entire array one at a time until the target is found. If not, move the first loop over one. Repeat until found

Optimized:
Make a hashmap with the value and the target sum. Each iteration adds the value and the index of the array to get to the sum in the hash.
When the number that is needed in a sum is found, it will return the index from the loop then the second index from the loop.
