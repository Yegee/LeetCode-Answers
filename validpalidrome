125. Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, 
it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Brute Force(If Applicable):
Create two pointers, one at the left character and right character. 
Makes each check is lower case and is a letter. If it is a character or space, make the pointer one higher
If there is a character that isn't the same, return false. Else return True.
